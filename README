	Music::Scales Readme
 
 Music::Scales supplies notes / offsets for assorted musical scales.
 Given a keynote A-G(#/b) and a scale-name, it will return  the scale in a
 number of formats - as an array of notenames, a hash of semitone-offsets
 for each note, or in MIDI / PDL format.

 See the module documentation for futher details.
