TODO list for Perl module Music::Scales

 Add further range of scales from http://www.cs.ruu.nl/pub/MIDI/DOC/scales.zip
 Improve enharmonic eqivalents.
 Microtones
 Frequency generation (although this is already done by PDL::Audio::Scale)
 Generate ragas,gamelan etc.  - maybe needs an 'ethnic' subset of modules
